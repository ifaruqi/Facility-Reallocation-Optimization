# Facility-Reallocation-Optimization

Service providers serve customers from several regional facilities. This project aims to optimize facility allocation to the customers using heuristic algorithms. Three heuristics algorithm are used, namely:

1. Sequential Constructive Heuristic
2. Greedy Adaptive Constructive Heuristic
3. First Improvement Heuristics

The result of the three heuristics algorithms are then compared to the optimal solution obtained by solving linear optimization problem
